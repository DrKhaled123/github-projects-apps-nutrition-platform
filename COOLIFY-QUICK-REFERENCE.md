# Should return: HTTP/2 200
```

**If DNS doesn't resolve:**
- Go to your domain registrar
- Add A record: `my` → `128.140.111.171`
- Wait 15 minutes

## 🔧 Part 2: Environment Variables (5 min)

**Where:** Coolify → Applications → DoctorHealthy1 → Environment Variables

**Quick Add (copy-paste this):**
```bash
JWT_SECRET=CHANGE-THIS-TO-RANDOM-64-CHARS-USE-openssl-rand-base64-48
ENV=production
PORT=8081
HOST=0.0.0.0
LOG_LEVEL=warn
DB_PATH=/app/data/app.db
RATE_LIMIT=100
API_KEY_PREFIX=dh_
API_KEY_LENGTH=32
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
SECURITY_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=1m
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://my.doctorhealthy1.com
```

**Generate Secure JWT_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n'
```
Then replace the JWT_SECRET value above.

## ✅ Verification Tests

Run these after deployment:

```bash
# Test 1: SSL Certificate
curl -I https://my.doctorhealthy1.com/health
# Expected: HTTP/2 200

# Test 2: Health Check
curl https://my.doctorhealthy1.com/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}

# Test 3: Frontend
open https://my.doctorhealthy1.com/
# Expected: Website loads with green lock 🔒

# Test 4: DNS
nslookup my.doctorhealthy1.com
# Expected: 128.140.111.171
```

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Not Secure" Warning
```bash
# Check DNS first
nslookup my.doctorhealthy1.com

# If DNS OK, check SSL in Coolify
# Dashboard → Domains → Should show green indicator

# If failed, click "Retry SSL"
```

### ❌ "Server Not Found"
```bash
# Check PORT environment variable
# Should be: PORT=8081

# Check logs for:
# "Server started on port 8081" ✅
```

### ❌ "Boxes with No Functions"
```bash
# Check browser console (F12)
# Look for CORS errors

# Verify CORS in main.go was updated
# Should allow: my.doctorhealthy1.com
```

### ❌ Data Lost After Deployment
```bash
# Check persistent storage
# Coolify → Storages → Should show "Mounted"

# Verify mount path: /app/data
```
